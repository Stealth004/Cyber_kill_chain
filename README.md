<h1>Cyber Kill Chain</h1>

<p>The cyber kill chain is a model that describes the stages of a cyber attack, from the initial infiltration of a system to the exfiltration of data. It was originally developed by Lockheed Martin to help organizations understand and defend against cyber threats, but it has since been adopted by many other companies and organizations.</p>

<p>The seven stages of the cyber kill chain are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reconnaissance: The attacker gathers information about the target system and its defenses.</li>
  <li>Weaponization: The attacker creates a weapon, such as a malicious software or exploit, to deliver to the target.</li>
  <li>Delivery: The weapon is delivered to the target, often through email or a website.</li>
  <li>Exploitation: The weapon is activated and exploits a vulnerability in the target system.</li>
  <li>Installation: The attacker installs malware on the target system to maintain control and continue the attack.</li>
  <li>Command and control: The attacker establishes a connection to the malware on the target system, allowing them to control it remotely.</li>
  <li>Actions on objectives: The attacker achieves their goals, such as stealing data or disrupting service.</li>
</ol>

<p>Understanding the cyber kill chain can help organizations identify and prevent attacks at different stages of the process, rather than just reacting after an attack has already occurred.</p>
